    //about Tofu (and the "raccoon")
    
    
    //a friend of some friend of mine on discord,
    //had his friend's 
    //betta fish die recently and asked
    //me to put it in the addon
    //(that discord friend of mine
    //also wanted raccoons very badly but 
    //i decided to add a raccoon spawn egg as 
    //an april fools joke and then
    //changed the text that appears in the
    //chat when you place a raccoon
    //from "april fools hahahaha" to
    //the message that appears now about getting it from mcpedl)

also, this is in a separate file instead of just being a comment in the betta fish's
render controller file because doing that somehow broke the render controllers
