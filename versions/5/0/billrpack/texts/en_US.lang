##########################


##hey there, read the ##notes for translation tips


##make sure to follow vanilla bedrock's style eg.
##translate spawn, end, and netherite to whatever bedrock(not java) translates them to


##if any mob name that is two words in english sounds good as one word in your language
##translate it to that one word, eg. Italian for banana duck: "Bananatra" instead of "Anatra Banana",
##though try to make the etymology of the combined word obvious


##feel free to ask me any other questions

Then, make them sit §aclose to each other§9 and sacrifice them by getting them §astruck by lightning§9.

chat.billeys_mobs.info.duckatrice=§e§l=========DUCKATRICE (PET)=========%1%1§r§l§6- General%1§r§9Duckatrices are §abig, flying ducks§9 that §ado not spawn naturally§9. The way to get a duckatrice is to §akill the Duckatrice Boss§9 and then use the "§aDuckatrice Amber§9" it drops on a §alevel 10 duck§9 of yours. The duckatrice's main use is being a §aflying ride§9. Duckatrices are §aalways tamed§9 and can be §ahealed with§9 anything ducks(seeds, carrots, etc.) or yutyrannuses(meat) can. §aRead the Duckatrice Boss's info book entry for how to summon it§9. %1%1§l§6- Obtaining%1§r§9To get a duckatrice you'll have to §asummon and defeat§9 the §aDuckatrice Boss§9 to get an item called §aDuckatrice Amber§9. Using duckatrice amber on a §alevel 10 duck§9 of yours will transform it into §ayour own pet duckatrice§9. Keep in mind however that the duckatrice is not an objective upgrade as duckatrices don't find items in grass and water like ducks do. After the transformation all data of the duck will be passed on to the duckatrice including owner, nametag, equipment, equipment color, etc. This means that §ayour duckatrice will be the same variant as the that transformed to it§9.%1%1§l§6- Riding%1§r§9To ride your duckatrice, put a §asaddle§9 on it and then right click it, long tap it or press the "Ride" button. The saddle can be removed by attempting to put another saddle on the duckatrice while it's already wearing one. To §astart flying§9 while on the duckatrice, §ajump§9, or fall off some height. §aLook up§9 to go up, look straight to go straight, or look down to go down. Duckatrices have §alimited stamina for going upwards§9 unless you §aboost§9 them with sweet items.%1%1§l§6- Boosting%1§r§9While riding a duckatrice, you can §aboost its speed§9 by feeding it §asweet items from this add-on§9(desert bananas, poultry oranges, penguin ice cream, etc.) or rat beer or warped wine. Length and strength of the speed boost varies by item. Also, duckatrices of higher level get an even stronger speed boost. While boosted, duckatrices can also §ago up freely§9.%1%1§l§6- Duckatrice's Stare Effect%1§r§9If you §apet§9(sneak + right click/long tap/etc.) your duckatrice empty handed, you will lose 1 level and your §ahelmet§9 will be temporalily granted the §aDuckatrice's Stare§9 effect which §adamages mobs that are angry at you if you look at them§9. Higher level duckatrices give higher levels of the stare effect.%1%1§l§d- Leveling%1§r§9Duckatrices can §alevel up§9 by killing mobs, when they level up §atheir health and attack damage increase§9, and some of their other abilities become better as said above. Mobs that level up by killing things §aprogress through leveling more by hitting mobs than by just killing§9, which means that to level up your mob faster, §amake it kill mobs with lots of health§9.
